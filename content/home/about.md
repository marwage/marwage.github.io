Since June 2021, I am a PhD student in the [LSDS group](https://lsds.doc.ic.ac.uk) at Imperial College London.

My reserach focuses on Systems for Machine Learning.

Before joining the [LSDS group](https://lsds.doc.ic.ac.uk), I did my Bachelor and Master at the
[Technical University of Munich](https://in.tum.de).
