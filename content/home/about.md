Since June 2021, I am a PhD student in the [LSDS](https://lsds.doc.ic.ac.uk) group at Imperial College London.

My research is in the area of Systems for Machine Learning. I focus on large-scale distributed deep learning.

Before joining the LSDS group, I did my Bachelor and Master at the [Technical University of Munich](https://in.tum.de).
