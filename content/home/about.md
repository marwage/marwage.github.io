Since June 2021, I have been a PhD student in the [Large-Scale Data & Systems Group](https://lsds.doc.ic.ac.uk) (LSDS) group at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/), where I conduct research in Machine Learning Systems (MLSys). Under the supervision of Professor [Peter Pietzuch](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~prp/), my primary focus is on large-scale distributed machine learning, particularly exploring the impact of resource changes on deep learning training systems.

Additionally, I collaborate with my second advisor, Professor [Mark van der Wilk](https://mvdw.uk), on Gaussian Processes (GP). Our research aims to improve benchmarking GP approximations for comparability and enhance the performance of GP inference.

Prior to joining the LSDS group, I completed both my Bachelor of Science and Master of Science in Informatics at the [Technical University of Munich](https://in.tum.de).
