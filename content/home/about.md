Since June 2021, I am a PhD student in the [Large-Scale Data & Systems Group](https://lsds.doc.ic.ac.uk) (LSDS) group at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/). Professor [Peter Pietzuch](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~prp/) supervises me. My research is in the area of Systems for Machine Learning. Specifically, I focus on large-scale distributed deep learning.

Before joining the LSDS group, I did my Bachelor of Science and Master of Science in Informatics at the [Technical University of Munich](https://in.tum.de).
